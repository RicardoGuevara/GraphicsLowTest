<h1 aling="center">LITTLE GRAPHIC ENGINE EXPERIMENTS</h1>
<p>
All the following tests was made in order to improove C++ skills 
and get some knowledge about graphic engines generic fundamentals, 
i'm not an expert, if you came over here searching for pure beautifull 
code practices, i'm so sorry, be pattient and please put all your furious
developer rage on a code review. Thanks
</p>

<h2>How to test it</h2>
<p>
Personally, i used MinGW (wich allows you to have common GNU C and C++ compilers)
to get the gcc compiler, so i compile directly from prompt (or any terminal) using<br>
<code>>> gcc ScriptName.cpp<code><br>
you can also use code::blocks or any C++ IDE to make it easier.

<h2>The "scratch" game engine:</h2>
<p>
at least an 80% of the theory, code fundamentals (and the header...) belongs to a series of game engine theory and applications by javidx9, found him at:<br>
